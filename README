Method for deriving (minimally labeled) dependency trees from the Thai CG Bank 
(Ruangrajitpakorn & Supnithi 2010), using a lexical dictionary for assigning 
dependency directions to the CG types associated with the grammatical entities 
in the CG Bank, falling back on a generic CG->CDG mapping in case of 
out-of-dictionary words. 

Optionally uses distributional ("brown-") clusters obtained through unsupervised 
processing of large amounts of (word-segmented) raw text in place of POS tags.
